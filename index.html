            <p>But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born <br>
                and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great <br>
                explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids <br>
                pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure <br>
                rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or <br>
                pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances <br>
                occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of <br>
                us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has <br>
                any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences,<br>
                or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?</p>
